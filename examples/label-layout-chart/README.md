# Label Layout Chart

An example chart that demonstrates label layout.

This chart looks at GitHub repository data, and for each language looks at how many repositories are owned by users, and how many are owned by organizations. Data points that land in the bottom right of the chart (beneath the diagonal) are ones that tend to be user-owned, whereas the few that are above the line tend to be organization-owned.

The label layout component allows us to selectively label a subset of these datapoints without overlaps.
