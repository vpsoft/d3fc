# Stacked Bar Chart

This example demonstrates a stacked bar chart using energy production data from [eurostat](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php).

The chart is constructed from the following components:

* A cartesian chart, with an ordinal y axis and a linear x axis.
* A repeat series of horizontally oriented stacked bar series.
* A [d3-legend](http://d3-legend.susielu.com) component.
