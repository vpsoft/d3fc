# WebGL With SVG Overlay

Demonstrates rendering a large dataset with WebGL and then rendering a subset 
of the data as an SVG overlay to allow simple interactions.

N.B. This example must be run via a web server in order for the data file to
be served, this can be done by running `npm start` from the project root.
