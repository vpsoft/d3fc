# Most popular programming languages on StackOverflow

This example was inspired by a video from Reddit showing [an animated chart of StackOverflow tag popularity](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/d2qrx6/this_video_shows_the_most_popular_programming/) - a style of chart known as a 'bar chart race'. 

The chart is rendered using various D3FC components, making good use of the built-in transition support. The code has various comments if you're interested in how it was constructed.
